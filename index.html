                <p class="text-muted text-left">When I worked in a second-hand bookshop – so easily pictured, if you don’t work in one, as a kind of paradise where charming old gentlemen browse eternally among calf-bound folios – the thing that chiefly struck me was the rarity of really bookish people. Our shop had an exceptionally interesting stock, yet I doubt whether ten per cent of our customers knew a good book from a bad one. First edition snobs were much commoner than lovers of literature, but oriental students haggling over cheap textbooks were commoner still, and vague-minded women looking for birthday presents for their nephews were commonest of all.

                    Many of the people who came to us were of the kind who would be a nuisance anywhere but have special opportunities in a bookshop. For example, the dear old lady who ‘wants a book for an invalid’ (a very common demand, that), and the other dear old lady who read such a nice book in 1897 and wonders whether you can find her a copy. Unfortunately she doesn’t remember the title or the author’s name or what the book was about, but she does remember that it had a red cover. But apart from these there are two well-known types of pest by whom every second-hand bookshop is haunted. One is the decayed person smelling of old breadcrusts who comes every day, sometimes several times a day, and tries to sell you worthless books. The other is the person who orders large quantities of books for which he has not the smallest intention of paying. In our shop we sold nothing on credit, but we would put books aside, or order them if necessary, for people who arranged to fetch them away later.</p>

            <p> Read it really carefully to get all the details even little details have a part in this exellent book! At first look it will look boring but once you read it ,it will blow your mind! And when I thought it coudn't get more exiting it proved me wrong every single time! It actually has 7 parts but once you read them it will be imposible to get your head out of it (spoiler alert) Voldemort was a very interesting character.And be sure to pick a team. It's really suspensefull and I am not going to give any more spoilers . You should read it at any chance you get.  Plus it also has movies and its a bestseller.It's auther is JK Rowling . You should also read her other books like Fantastic Beasts and etc. She is a really good author.  </p>
